<h5>What is this?</h5>
<p>This metric is like canvas fingerprinting, but for audio rather than graphics. An audio sample is generated. That audio sample is then serialized and measured to provide this fingerprint.

<h5>How is this used in your fingerprint?</h5>
<p>
Like canvas fingerprinting, this can be unique depending on your audio card and drivers, and usually will not change over time. In modern handheld devices and laptops, graphics cards and audio cards will vary depending on the model. But they will not change between devices of the same model. For desktop computers, especially ones with customized hardware, the audio card will provide new information. This information is useful for fingerprinting.
