<h5>What is this?</h5>
<p>WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics. The method for generating a “hash of WebGL fingerprint” is very similar to generating a “hash of canvas fingerprint.” Its method is to use your browser to generate graphics, extracting data from how each pixel is rendered, serialize the result, and hash it.

<h5>How is this used in your fingerprint?</h5>
<p>The WebGL and canvas fingerprinting results are closely linked. They both examine browser-rendered graphics for tiny differences between users.
